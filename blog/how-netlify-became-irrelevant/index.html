<p>Launching a product is a good thing… except when it is not, like it is the case with the new analytics product from Netlify.</p>

<p>First of all, the new product launch of Netlify makes it easier to compare them to their biggest competitor: CloudCannon. Netlify and CloudCannon both offer static website hosting on a CDN with analytics (through log analysis). Both will process your forms with an optional captcha and both offer a CMS for your static website. The main difference is their pricing.</p>

<p>Netlify</p>

<ul>
  <li>price: 9 dollar per month per website</li>
  <li>the fee is for the analytics only</li>
  <li>100 forms per month per site (+19 dollar per month if you need more)</li>
</ul>

<p>CloudCannon</p>

<ul>
  <li>price: 25 dollar per month for unlimited websites</li>
  <li>analytics are included</li>
  <li>unlimited forms</li>
</ul>

<p>Comparing these two options suddenly became very easy. Only if you want a single website with limited form submissions you should choose Netlify.</p>

<p>Secondly, CloudCannon has a more mature product than Netlify. Until today we could have thought that the lack of analytics in Netlify was due to its immaturaty. We could have hoped (or expect) that Netlify would add this missing feature sooner or later. Now we know it wants you to pay a premium for it. Making a big fuss about a paid feature your competitor introduced long ago (for free), is not very smart. With this move Netlify loses (a lot of) its credibility. By trying to cash on such a basic functionality, Netlify damages the trust of its clients.</p>

<p>In other words: Netlify made their product comparable and showed its true colors. A very dumb move from an otherwise smart and popular company.</p>
